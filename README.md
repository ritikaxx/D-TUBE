## D-TUBE


A video player or a decentralized youtube like platform, for uploading videos, along with their description, Dtube works on the Ethereum network and provides its users with all the advantages of Blockchain Decentralized applications.


Storing big media files like videos on the blockchain is both very costly and space inefficient hence Dtube utilizes the power of decentralized system of IPFS-Inter Planetary File System , and hence only storing the hash of the videos to the blockchain.


On DTube nobody can take down your video and steal your video and claim it as their own. It's ad-free, hence users can watch videos without those ads. The application will be free from censorship ,and no one can hide your videos as there is no central body controlling the application.  

## What is blockchain?

Blockchain is a decentralized technology that allows for secure data sharing. Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger for maintaining a permanent and tamper-proof record of transactional data. 
A blockchain functions as a decentralized database that is managed by computers belonging to a peer-to-peer P2P network. Each of the computers in the distributed network maintains a copy of the ledger to prevent a single point of failure and all copies are updated and validated simultaneously. 

Blockchain applications are being explored in many industries as a secure and cost-effective way to create and manage a distributed database and maintain records for digital transactions of all types. In this case, the "transactions" are videos, which are distributed across the decentralized network.

## Why is blockchain secure?

Blockchain is secure because it relies heavily on secure cryptographic hash functions. These hash functions, a digital signature, and a proof-of-work algorithm ensure that the data is valid and not tampered with. Overall, blockchain is a revolutionary, secure technology.
